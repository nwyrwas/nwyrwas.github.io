    <h2>Professional Self-Assessment</h2>
    <p>
      My journey through Southern New Hampshire University’s Computer Science program has allowed me to develop a strong foundation in software design, full-stack development, secure coding, and data-driven problem solving.
      Throughout my coursework, I have gained experience working with Python, C++, Java, and web frameworks while applying system analysis, reverse engineering, and database management principles to real-world challenges.
    </p>
    <p>
      The CS-499 Capstone represents the culmination of these skills by integrating a multi-layered project that connects database interaction, visualization, and security.
      The artifacts and enhancements presented below demonstrate measurable growth in my ability to design scalable systems, write maintainable code, and apply professional software engineering standards.
      Each enhancement was selected to highlight the program outcomes of <strong>software design and development</strong>, <strong>algorithmic analysis</strong>, <strong>security</strong>, and <strong>collaboration using version control</strong>.

    <h2>Code Review Summary</h2>
    <p>
      Before beginning my enhancements, I conducted a complete code review of my CS-340 client-server repository.
      This process involved evaluating the original CRUD architecture, testing MongoDB operations, and ensuring adherence to secure coding principles.
      I documented design inefficiencies such as limited exception handling, missing modularity, and the lack of data visualization.
      The review guided my enhancement plan by identifying key areas for improvement—specifically transitioning from a static Flask interface to an interactive Dash framework.

    <h2>Original Artifact – CS-340 Client-Server Development</h2>
    <p>
      The original artifact was developed in the CS-340 Client-Server Development course. It consisted of a Python Flask web application integrated with MongoDB to manage an animal shelter’s database.
      The system implemented full CRUD functionality through a class called <code>AnimalShelter</code>, which allowed authenticated users to perform create, read, update, and delete operations.
    </p>
    <p>
      This foundational artifact demonstrated my early understanding of API endpoints, data persistence, and backend interaction.

    <h2>Enhanced Artifact – CS-499 Capstone Project Dashboard</h2>
    <p>
      For my capstone enhancement, I transformed the original server-based application into a dynamic full-stack data analytics dashboard using <strong>Python Dash, MongoDB, Matplotlib, and Leaflet</strong>.
      The upgraded system enables users to visualize adoption and rescue data in real-time with advanced search, filters, and mapping capabilities.
      It also implements dark-mode UI styling, performance-optimized queries, and chart rendering that displays interactive adoption insights.
    </p>
    <p>
      This enhancement demonstrates practical skills in UI/UX design, data visualization, and distributed system integration while following professional software development standards such as modular architecture, code reuse, and secure database access.

    <h2>Enhancement Narrative and Skill Demonstration</h2>
    <h3>Enhancement Overview</h3>
    <p>
      My enhancements focused on usability, interactivity, and data visualization. I integrated Dash components to replace static HTML, added responsive design features, and implemented Matplotlib for generating real-time charts.
      Additionally, I refactored database operations to include query parameterization, improving both security and performance.
    </p>
    <h3>Skills Demonstrated</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Software Engineering:</strong> Designed modular Python components for maintainability and scalability.</li>
      <li><strong>Databases:</strong> Implemented secure CRUD operations with MongoDB and query optimization.</li>
      <li><strong>Data Visualization:</strong> Used Matplotlib and Dash callbacks to generate interactive charts.</li>
      <li><strong>Security:</strong> Enforced safe database connections and data validation for all queries.</li>
      <li><strong>Collaboration:</strong> Version control with Git and GitHub to track all enhancements and testing.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Course Outcome Alignment</h3>
    <p>
      These enhancements align directly with SNHU’s Computer Science program outcomes:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Design and evaluate computing solutions to meet a given set of requirements.</li>
      <li>Apply principles of computing and other relevant disciplines to analyze problems.</li>
